I'm Anthony Pereira and I'm in the last year of my degree in Informatics Engineering at the University of Aveiro.
I'm interested in several areas, one being Computer Scinece, and that's why I like to think that one day I will be a "man of 7 crafts". :muscle::muscle:
I like to play League of Legends, watch some series or animes, read some mangas or even watch some documentary films about History.
Oh, I almost forgot - Eurovision Song Contest fanatic here!! :blush: :blush:


:cyclone: Feel free to pass through the stones and find me in the 18th century somehere in the Highlands. :sunrise_over_mountains: :sunrise_over_mountains: :cyclone:
