I'm **Anthony Pereira** and I'm in the last year of my degree in Informatics Engineering at the University of Aveiro.
I'm interested in several areas, one being Computer Science, and that's why I like to think that one day I will be a "man of 7 crafts". :muscle::muscle:
In my free time, I like to play League of Legends, watch some series like OUTLANDER or animes, read some mangas or even watch some documentary films about History.
Oh, I almost forgot - Eurovision Song Contest fanatic here!! :blush: :blush:


:cyclone: Feel free to pass through the stones and find me in the 18th century somewhere in the Highlands. :sunrise_over_mountains: :sunrise_over_mountains: :cyclone:
